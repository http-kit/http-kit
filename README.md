# http-kit

### Simple, high-performance event-driven HTTP client+server for Clojure

http-kit is a minimalist and efficient Ring-compatible HTTP client+server for Clojure.

It uses an event-driven architecture to support highly concurrent a/synchronous web applications, and features a simple unified API for WebSocket and HTTP long-polling/streaming.

## Latest release/s

- `2024-02-30` `v2.8.0`: [release info](../../releases/tag/v2.8.0)

See [here][GitHub releases] for earlier releases.

## Why http-kit?

- **Ring compliant**: http-kit is a drop-in replacement for the standard Ring Jetty adapter. You can use it with all your current libraries and middleware.

- **High performance**: http-kit uses an event-driven architecture like nginx, and is **fast**. See [here](#performance) for benchmarks.

- **High concurrency**: http-kit is **efficient**. Its RAM usage is O(n), with only few kB used per connection. Tests have [shown](https://http-kit.github.io/600k-concurrent-connection-http-kit.html) http-kit happily serving >600k concurrent connections.

- **Clean, simple, small**: written from the ground-up to be **lean**, the entire http-kit client+server JAR is ~90kB with **zero dependencies** and ~3k total lines of code.

- **Sync or async**: synchronous is simple, asynchronous fast & flexible. With http-kit you get the best of both with a simple API that lets you mix & match to best fit your use case.

- **WebSockets**: realtime web apps are a breeze with http-kit, with great out-the-box support for both WebSockets and efficient HTTP long-polling.

## Production usage

For production environments, it's **strongly recommended** to run http-kit behind a well-configured and battle-hardened reverse proxy like [nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/), [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy), [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/), [AWS ALB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html), etc.

See [here](../../wiki/3-Server#production-environments) for more info.

## Performance

http-kit now includes an extensive single-system **benchmark suite** that can be easily customized and run in your own environment.

See [here](../../wiki/4-Benchmarking) for http-kit's **benchmark philosophy**, usage info, detailed results, etc.

Selected example results:

> **Important**: as with all benchmarks - please be skeptical and check the details for important context!

## Project status

http-kit was created by [@shenfeng][], but is currently being maintained by its community.

A big thank-you to the [current contributors](../../graphs/contributors) for keeping the project going! **Additional contributors very welcome**: please ping me if you'd be interested in lending a hand.
