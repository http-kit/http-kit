# HTTP Kit

## High-performance event-driven HTTP client/server for Clojure

See **[http-kit.org](http://http-kit.org)** for documentation, examples, benchmarks, etc.

Current [semantic](http://semver.org/) version:

```clj
[http-kit "2.0.1"]  ; WebSocket and async API are not compatible with the RC releases.
```


### Hack locally

Hacker friendly: Zero dependency, written from ground-up with only ~3k lines of code (including java), clean and tidy.

```sh
# modify as you want, unit tests back you up
lein test

# may be useful. more info, see the code server_test.clj
./scripts/start_test_server

```
