Current [semantic](http://semver.org/) version: `[http-kit "2.0.0-RC4"]`.

### Hack locally

Hacker fridenly: only ~3k lines of code (including java), clean and tidy.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:http-kit/http-kit.git

# modify as you want, unit tests back you up
lein test

# may be useful. more info, see the code server_test.clj
./scripts/run_http_requests

```
