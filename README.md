## Project status

http-kit's author ([@shenfeng][]) unfortunately hasn't had much time to maintain http-kit recently. To help out I'll be doing basic issue triage, accepting minor/obvious PRs, etc.

A big thank you to the **[current contributors](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/graphs/contributors)** for keeping the project going! **Additional contributors welcome**: please ping me if you'd be interested in lending a hand.

### Debugging SSLHandshakeException [SNI support to be enabled by default?](http)s://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/issues/393)

If you just use http-kit client and you get an exception:

`javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure`

it means that you are trying to contact a website which uses SNI during
the SSL handshake but the default client does not handle SNI properly and
this generates the handshake exception.

Since this is a common source of confusion, a new namespace have been
introduced (`org.http-kit.sni-client`) which provides a pre configured
client with a :sni-configurer in the var `default-sni-client`.

The new default-sni-client can be used as is (just remenber to deref it),
passing it to `request` function via the :client option, or can be set as
the default one for the whole application:

``` clojure
(alter-var-root #'org.http-kit.client/*default-client* default-sni-client)
```

Please refer to `org.http-kit.sni-client` and `org.http-kit.client`
namespaces for further details.

### Hack locally

Hacker friendly: zero dependencies, written from the ground-up with only ~3.5k lines of code (including java), clean and tidy.

```sh
# Modify as you want, unit tests back you up:
lein test

# May be useful (more info), see `server_test.clj`:
./scripts/start_test_server

# Some numbers on how fast can http-kit's client can run:
lein test :benchmark
```
