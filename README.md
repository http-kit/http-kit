# HTTP Kit

### A high-performance event-driven HTTP client+server for Clojure

[CHANGELOG][] | Current [semantic](http://semver.org/) version/s:

```clojure
[http-kit "2.3.0-alpha2"] ; Dev    - See CHANGELOG for details
[http-kit "2.2.0"]        ; Stable - Published by contributors

## Project status

http-kit's author ([@shenfeng][]) unfortunately hasn't had much time to maintain http-kit recently. To help out I'll be doing basic issue triage, accepting minor/obvious PRs, etc.

A big thank you to the **[current contributors](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/graphs/contributors)** for keeping the project going! **Additional contributors welcome**: please ping me if you'd be interested in lending a hand.

### Hack locally

Hacker friendly: zero dependencies, written from the ground-up with only ~3.5k lines of code (including java), clean and tidy.

```sh
# Modify as you want, unit tests back you up:
lein test

# May be useful (more info), see `server_test.clj`:
./scripts/start_test_server

# Some numbers on how fast can http-kit's client can run:
lein test :benchmark
```
